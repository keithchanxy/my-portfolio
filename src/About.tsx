        My journey into computational design began during my internship at
        Witteveen+Bos, where I discovered the potential of algorithm-driven
        design to automate repetitive tasks and streamline design processes.
        This sparked a deep interest in computational tools, leading me to
        self-learn about visual programming platforms like Grasshopper and
        Dynamo, high level programming languages such as C# and Python, and
        apply them in my academic and professional projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-4">
        Since then, with over 4 years of experience in computational design,
        I've had the opportunity to work with industry leaders like Lendlease
        Singapore (Podium), JTC Corporation, and Mott MacDonald Singapore, where
        I have designed and developed custom Grasshopper plugins, automated BIM
        workflows, and integrated computational design techniques to solve
        complex challenges.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-4">
        Outside of work, I stay active with road cycling, hiking, and running,
        which help me unwind and connect with nature. I also enjoy videography
        and photography, capturing everyday moments and landscapes. These
        activities provide a refreshing break and offer a new perspective on the
        world around me. I am passionate and a firm believer that computational
        design is more than just a toolâ€”it's a means of rethinking how we design
        and build.
